If you're a developer and you want to help, I'm very happy to hear that. First of all, go to [waffle.io](http://waffle.io/orthes/medium-editor-insert-plugin) (that's the blue icon above),
where you'll find list of all work, that need to be done. Feel free to grab one issue, assign it to yourself and start working.

The plugin uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for automating development tasks and [Bower](http://bower.io/) for package management. To install all the necessities for development run these commands:

```
npm install
bower install
```

These are available Grunt tasks:

- **js**: runs jshint, uglify and handlebars
- **css**: runs sass, autoprefixer, csso and usebanner
- **test**: runs jshint and qunit
- **watch**: watches for modifications on script/scss files and runs js/css task

Please, test you're code to your best knowledge, especially if you're adding new features.

If you want to make sure, that your code runs smoothly in all browsers, you can use [Test'em](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) to run tests in all browsers at the same time.
